> ⚠️ Spark launcher support is work in progress. Functionality and configuration will change—please treat this guide as a placeholder and track progress on GitHub.

We are actively shaping the Spark integration to match the stability of the Bash and Ray launchers. If you would like to participate in early tests or discuss requirements, open an issue or reach out on the Dagster Slack.
